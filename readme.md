# SyncWatch

Simple 1-way sync utility. I use this to automatically transfer files
that I have modified locally to a remote machine (via rsync).

This is just a personal script, but pull requests are welcome.

Also, still a work in progress. Currently targeted for OSX.

### Install

`gem install syncwatch`

https://rubygems.org/gems/syncwatch
